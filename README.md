# milestone-demos

This repository contains the yaml files used for the release workstream HACBS milestone demos.

These yaml files assume you have bootstrapped a working appstudio configuration from [infra-deployments](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments).

## Tags

Milestones are separated in this repository by tags.
To view the demo resources for a previous milestone, simply checkout its tag.
Be warned, however, that we make no guarantee that the past demo resources work with the latest HACBS deployment.
Once a milestone passes, we will only be focusing on demo resources for the next milestone.
So, if you need working demo resources, use the `main` branch.
